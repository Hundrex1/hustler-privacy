    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-12-18</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>App name:</strong> Hustler</p>
      <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Hustler recommends side-hustles based on your profile (skills, location, preferences) and helps you follow daily/weekly tasks with check-ins.</p>
      <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:hundrexa@gmail.com">hundrexa@gmail.com</a></p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Hustler (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Hustler mobile and web app (the “Service”).
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Account and authentication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you sign in with Google, we receive a user identifier and basic account information from Google via Supabase Auth (e.g., your email address and profile identifier).</li>
      <li>We store an internal account ID to keep you logged in and to associate your data with your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Profile information you provide</h3>
    <p>We collect and store the information you enter in onboarding or settings, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skills (tags) and optional “other skills” text</li>
      <li>Country and city</li>
      <li>Preferences like comfort with selling, online vs offline preference, hours per week, and startup budget (if provided)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Usage and product analytics</h3>
    <p>
      We collect analytics about how the app is used to improve the Service. This can include events such as:
      onboarding completion, recommendation refresh, starting a hustle, task completion, and check-ins.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Technical data</h3>
    <p>
      Like most apps, we may collect basic technical information such as device type, operating system, app version,
      approximate timestamps, and diagnostic logs when errors occur.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide the Service:</strong> create your account, save your profile, generate hustle recommendations, generate tasks, and show resources.</li>
      <li><strong>To personalize:</strong> tailor recommendations to your skills, preferences, and location.</li>
      <li><strong>To improve and operate:</strong> monitor performance, debug issues, and improve features.</li>
      <li><strong>To communicate:</strong> respond to support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers that help us run the Service, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (authentication, database, and server functions)</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics provider</strong> (e.g., PostHog) for product analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers process data on our behalf to provide the Service, subject to their own terms and privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Resources and external links</h2>
    <p>
      The app may show links to third-party resources (e.g., YouTube tutorials or websites). If you open an external link,
      you are leaving our Service and the third party’s privacy policy applies.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations,
      resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You can request deletion (see below).
    </p>

    <h2>7) Your choices and rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edit your profile:</strong> you can update skills and preferences in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion request:</strong> you can request deletion of your account data by emailing <a href="mailto:hundrexa@gmail.com">hundrexa@gmail.com</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics controls:</strong> if we add in-app analytics controls in the future, they will appear in Settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
      so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>10) International users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access the Service from outside the country where our servers are located, your information may be processed in other countries
      where data protection laws may differ.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Contact</h2>
    <p>
